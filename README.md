## Approach and Reasons

-   **Componentization:** Designed components with reusability in mind, breaking down the Figma design into modular units.

-   **Task Segmentation:** Tackled the challenge by focusing on specific tasks, such as developing a single card component first, before scaling to the entire design.

-   **React Hooks:** Leveraged React hooks (e.g., useState) to efficiently manage the application state.

-   **Dynamic Components:** Utilized props to make components dynamic and reusable, ensuring flexibility in adapting to different requirements.

-   **Dynamic Data Management:** To address the challenge of making the application pages dynamic, I opted for a JSON file to manage incoming data efficiently. This decision allows for easy data manipulation, scalability, and swift adjustments when changes are needed.

-   **Responsive Styling with Tailwind:** Handling styles across different responsive layouts presented challenges, which were effectively tackled using Tailwind CSS. Custom workarounds were implemented to ensure an attractive and seamless design. Tailwind's flexibility allowed for dynamic styling adjustments, aligning the application closely with the Figma design.

-   **Precision from Figma to Code:** Implemented design details with precision, calculating margins and padding to accurately translate the Figma design into React and Tailwind code.

-   **Problem Solving Collaborations:** Various challenges encountered during development were resolved through a combination of resources, including Stack Overflow, ChatGPT, and Google. Leveraging these platforms enabled me to overcome obstacles and implement effective solutions.

-   **Code Organization and Readability:** I organized different components into separate files, emphasizing accurate naming for components and variables. This approach enhances code readability and facilitates easier code management in case of bugs or future updates.

## Conclusion

This approach prioritizes dynamic data management, responsive styling, effective problem-solving, and simplified code organization. The decisions made were aimed at improving maintainability, scalability, and overall code readability. This readme serves as documentation for the strategic choices made throughout the development of the application.
